C - Dynamic libraries

A dynamic library is a type of library that is linked to an application at runtime, rather than at compile time. This means that the library is loaded into memory only when it is needed, and can be unloaded from memory when it is no longer required. Dynamic libraries are also known as shared libraries.

Here are the steps to create and use a dynamic library:


 //1 -Write the code for your library. This code should contain the functions that you want to make available to other programs.

//2 -Compile the code to create an object file. This object file contains the compiled code, but is not yet a library.

//3 -Use a tool like "ld" to create the dynamic library file from the object file. The exact command will depend on the operating system and programming language you are using.

// 4-Once you have created the dynamic library, you can use it in other programs. To use it, you need to link your program to the library. This can be done using a linker tool like "ld" or by specifying the library in your program's build configuration.


To use a dynamic library in your program, you need to first make sure that the library is installed on your system. Then, you need to link your program to the library using the appropriate linker flags. Once your program is linked to the library, you can use the functions in the library just like you would use any other function in your program.
