This repository provides an introduction to search algorithms in programming. Search algorithms are techniques used to find specific items or determine the presence of an element within a collection of data. They are particularly useful when working with large data sets or when efficiency is a concern.

## Algorithms Covered

This repository covers the following search algorithms:

1. Linear Search: A basic algorithm that checks each element in a list one by one until the desired item is found or the entire list has been traversed.

2. Binary Search: An efficient algorithm applicable to sorted lists. It repeatedly divides the search space in half, discarding the half where the target element cannot exist.

3. Hashing: A technique that uses a hash function to map data to a fixed-size array called a hash table, allowing for constant-time retrieval of elements.

4. Depth-First Search (DFS): An algorithm used to traverse or search tree or graph structures. It explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

5. Breadth-First Search (BFS): An algorithm used to traverse or search tree or graph structures. It explores all the vertices at the current level before moving to the next level.

6. A* Search: A heuristic search algorithm often used in pathfinding and graph traversal problems. It considers the cost of reaching a node along with the estimated cost to the goal.

## Examples

To help understand these algorithms, this repository provides simple examples for each algorithm, explaining their step-by-step execution and expected outputs. The examples are designed to be beginner-friendly and easy to follow.

## Usage

Each algorithm is implemented in a separate file, and the examples are provided in the form of code snippets or pseudocode. You can choose your preferred programming language and refer to the relevant files for implementation details and usage instructions.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you would like to add more algorithms, provide improvements to existing examples, or fix any issues.
